% ARX models could be used for prediction and forecasting of the future. As data generated for the future 
% is similar to past/original data, it could be used for synthetic data generation. <br>
% An ARX model, which stands for AutoRegressive with eXogenous input model, is a type of linear
% time-series model commonly used in statistics and econometrics for modeling and forecasting data. <br>
% It falls under the broader category of autoregressive models. <br>
% A nonlinear ARX (AutoRegressive with eXogenous input) model is a type of time series model that 
% extends the traditional linear ARX model to accommodate non-linear relationships between the
% variables. <br> In a nonlinear ARX model, the relationship between the current value of the time series 
% and its lagged values, as well as the exogenous variables, is expressed in a nonlinear form.
